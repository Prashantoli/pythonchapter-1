MODULES:
A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) that can be imported 
and used in our programs.
For eg:- flask, pyjokes etc
Types of Modules:
1. Built in Modules ( pre installed in python)
 For eg:- OS, random 
2. External Modules (Need to install using pip)

PIP:
Pip is the package manager for python . You can use pip to install a module in your system.

COMMENT:
Comments are used to write something which the programming doesnot want to execute.
1. Single-Line Comments
 Description: Single-line comments begin with a hash symbol (#). Everything after the #
on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.
2. Multi-Line Comments (or Block Comments)
 Description: Multi-line comments can be created by placing a # at the beginning of each 
line. Alternatively, you can use triple quotes (''' or """) to create a multi-line string that 
can act as a comment. While the latter is technically a string and not a comment, it can be 
used as a comment when it is not assigned to a variable or used in an expression.
